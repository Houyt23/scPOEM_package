Description: This package provides a workflow to jointly embed chromatin accessibility peaks and expressed genes into a shared low-dimensional space using single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. It integrates regulatory relationships among peak-peak interactions (via Cicero), peak-gene interactions (using Lasso, random forest, and XGBoost), and gene-gene interactions (using principal component regression). Additionally, it supports the comparison of regulatory genes between two conditions through manifold alignment implemented in scTenifoldNet.
